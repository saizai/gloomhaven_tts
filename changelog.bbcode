Changelog:

[b]v12[/b]

Printing 2 cards
- Achievements: "The Demon Dethroned" & "The Rift Closed" -> "The Rift Neutralized"
- Brute 11


[b]v11.3.2[/b]

Removed redundant maps from CI 4 initial bag


[b]v11.3.1[/b]

Fixed stage tool eating itself


[b]v11.3[/b]

Added Capital Intrigue 4 - fully componentized and progressive-unlock. Totally spoiler-free, unlike the PDF version. :-)

Hopefully this shows what I have in mind for how the rest of it should work.

Fixed some layout issues - help cards being reversed, stage tool too close to admin zone, CI 3 being in unlockable content rather than unlockable scenarios container.


[b]v11.2[/b]

Put Ignore Me tool on table by default, not picked up by tools bag, because it has to be out for the ignored-GUIDs script to be triggered.

Should fix the "board is getting packed by stage" issue.


[b]v11.1[/b]

Fixed [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1358687444]counting bags[/url].


[b]v11[/b]

Added Capital Intrigue scenario 3, componentized.


[b]v10.6[/b]

Added [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1212241040]packup bags[/url] for players
- Note: these are (for now) player/color specific, i.e. they won't unpack correctly if you move them to a different player board
Added player modifier deck spawner temporarily (pending it being put in the class envelopes)


[b]v10.5[/b]

Fixed board to be ignored by stage tool & non-interactable.

Moved tools bag to inside the admin hidden/locked zone.


[b]v10.4[/b]

Changed board surface to use Gloomhaven's map background texture. Should be easier to see stuff on it.

Made grid lines brownish to match.


[b]v10.3[/b]

Fixed contents of main campaign 1 bag.


[b]v10.2[/b]

Moved all update bags to a [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/saizai/myworkshopfiles/?appid=286160]separate mod[/url], to reduce cruft in the main one.

Changed all counting bowls to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/saizai/myworkshopfiles/?appid=286160]custom made counting bags[/url]. Purses for everyone! Yes, they work nested too. They will auto-fix GUIDs, and are more portable.

Now the Sanctuary bag is packed up with the rest of town stuff.


[b]v10.1[/b]

Turned shooting stars off by default


[b]v10[/b]

Added full sealed envelope contents & original English town records


[b]v9[/b]

Clarified several notecards in the starting board - in particular, the character & party setup notecard.
Added stage bag of initial layout notecards
Hid unlockable items in bags to reduce spoilers
Hid & locked mod tools to player color black (admin). You can turn zone locking on or off by flipping the zone lock tool.
Updated Vermling stats mat to correct # (10, not 6).
Added 'torn card' symbol by discard bag
Tweaked placement of various items (e.g. actions mat, Steam avatar chips, tools, city/road help)
Added snap points for envelopes, unlockable action decks, character sheets, & various pre-placed items
Put unlockable scenarios & random items cards in unlockables chest

The Bless deck is relevant to both combat and city, so I left it out for all cases. Same for the unlocked scenarios tome, money tokens, & stage tool.


[b]v8.2[/b]

To save on video memory and clutter, most of the sidebar content is hidden when not in use. For the moment (it's WIP), they're in memory bags.

There are 4 on the right:
* Gloomhaven city
* Unlockable content (starts hidden)
* World map (starts hidden)
* Combat  (starts hidden)

And 2 above:
* Map setup  (starts hidden)
* Tools (weather, moderation, etc)   (starts hidden)

Just click 'place' on the bags you want to put out. If you want to be able to hide it again, don't delete the bags; just leave them there and click 'recall' to hide it when not in use.

A few tools are left out, because they have to be on the table to work.


[b]v8.1[/b]

Added toggle button for shooting stars effect, removed duplicate copies of it.

[b]v7.3[/b]

Re-fix stars effect (moving to y=800, changing from board to generic, removing all physics)
Steam-cloud all assets


[b]v7.2[/b]

Minor fix to y location of stars effect


[b]v7.1 (2018-04-05)[/b]

Added some aesthetics bits:

[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=745999113]Avatar Spawner[/url]
[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=946300090]Counting Bowl[/url] for players too (not just sanctuary)
[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=377839975]Milky Way background[/url]
[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=948287591]Starry Sky - particle system[/url]

You can disable the shooting stars effect by right clicking on them and selecting looping effect -> 2 (off).
