These are categorized roughly in order of skill / tool levels required.

# Research

* Kingdom Death Monster: Scripted v2 - check out how it handles manual

# Simple but grindy


## In-TTS

* Put official 3-digit ID # / map # of each item in its description (e.g. *ID: 123* or *ID: A2*)
  * if ambiguous (e.g. blue vs red designed items), add something to disambiguate the nonstandard one & document in spreadsheet
  * if no official ID, create one in spreadsheet and describe what it is

## Out-of-TTS

* Make spreadsheet of info of *all* contents.
* Item cards (partially complete)
  * 3-digit ID #s (incl. for items w/ more than one copy)
  * text (corrected w/ errata if any)
  * corrected (boolean) (whether this has been updated with errata from original version)
  * FAQ / errata text (except parts that are edited in)
  * broken down item effects, e.g. column 'heal' value 'self 3'; column 'other' for anything left over
* Terrain tiles
  * ID: map coding symbol(s) as below
  * name
  * full rules paragraph, including FAQ / errata
* Map tiles (always in canonical orientation, text of map ID is right side up)
  * ID (e.g. A2b)
  * type - *wood* ("man-made wood"), *stone* ("man-made stone"), *cave* ("natural stone"), or *earth*
  * orientation - *horizontal* (bottom of hex is flat) or *vertical* (side of hex is flat)
  * contents, starting from top left corner, using coding system below
  * Example: A2b
    * ID: A2b
    * Type: ice
    * Orientation: vertical
    * Contents:

    * `a` `A` `b` `B` `c` `C` monster spawn points. a, b, c = 2p, 3p, 4p; lower = regular, caps = elite
    * `(numbers 0-9)` progressive unlock codes.
      * `0` is the initially revealed state. `9` is the scenario (successful) conclusion state.
    * `(multiple numbers)` unlock states in which this is visible. When entered / triggered, any states not yet revealed become revealed.
      * E.g. all sections of map that are revealed if door 1 is opened should be labeled with 1. Door 1 itself should be labeled `/01` (since it's visible by default and triggers visibility of section 1).
      * This can also be on triggers, e.g. label a sub-goal card as `>01` to indicate that that sub-goal is visible by default, and triggering it spawns / makes visible all stuff labeled `1`. Or on a pressure plate, or whatever else...
      * Note: these numbers are for coding purposes, and won't always line up exactly with the scenario description.
    * Monsters:
      * `TBD` ...

### Unlock coding example - ItU scenario 3

There are 4 different zones due to doors, which should be coded 0-3. Two doors are labeled "1" in the scenario document, and scenario text. Those two doors, and the tile with the "1"-labeled scenario text, should all be additionally coded `5`. So clockwise from top left, the doors would be coded as `/015`, `/02`, `/235`, and `/13`.

The scenario goal can't readily be map-coded, so label the scenario goal tile `>09`, and the conclusion, reward, & transition tiles `9`. The scenario goal tile will automatically get a button attached to it (to trigger when complete) that will reveal the scenario completion content when triggered.


### Full scenario coding example - Main Campaign Scenario 1

Assets:

1. Tile of scenario name and requirements (*not* goal)
2. Tile of scenario goal
3. Tile of scenario introduction text
4. Tile of text labeled as part 1
5. Tile of conclusion text
6. Location 2 map tile
7. Party Achievement: First Steps tile
8. Treasure chest 07

(todo)


## Layout

* Add modifier decks to each class
* Items & city board:
  * put all city-type items into a lockable holder on the city board, separated out to individual cards (for easy search)
  * have a separate unlockable holder for reward etc items, again searchable
* Remove duplicative / redundant help objects (after description-based help has been added)

### Blocked pending data-based info above for auto generation

* Lay out scenarios (improve ItU, do others)
  * use entry point tokens
  * use special spawn-point & type-per-player-count tokens so scripting can take over spawning, randomization, etc
  * put bottom edge of map at bottom of board as possible
  * put monster stat sheets, ability cards w/ mats, monster modifier deck w/ mat above map
  * put element tracker to the side of map; delete the round tracker piece unless the scenario calls for it

# Content

* Scenario board layout zone labels (e.g. title, goal, flavor text, rules, content, maps, etc)
* Tutorial for new players to run through setup & main scenario 1
* Cloudify assets from pigneedle, mapmaking, etc, and re-import
* Componentize FAQ, put bits where they belong, remove from FAQ object
* Fix map tiles that are reversed
* Fully re-import & spoiler-minimize scenarios - 1 object per scenario, not per page (i.e. you don't see parts of the next scenario that happen to be printed on the same page in the book), & smaller file sizes too
* Modify items that have errata, mark with a symbol to signify errata'd (e.g. euro? dagger?)
* Reminder tokens for abilities, statuses, etc (eg shield, retaliate, jump)
* Token background for 'immunity to X'
* Split map/tokens & tools sidebar into 2 pieces
 * provide button for mod player to toggle tool zone invisibility
* Mat:
  * battle goal
  * character sheet
  * class envelope
  * more item slots (level 9 = 4 + more-item gear)
  * equipped item slots - char level requirement (max items = ceil(L/2))
  * clarify 2 handed / 1 handed slots (can have 1 2h xor 2 1h)
  * non-equipped item deck
  * personal quest
  * scenario kill credits
  * summon minis

# Scripting

## Basic

* Horizontal & vertical grid-setter tokens - just set grid to that state when put on board, put the right state in the scenario bag
* Slider for board darkness
* Button to replace spawn point & type-per-level tokens with monster of correct type
* Element board: end-of-round button to increment counter and decrement elements
* City board: add toggle buttons to the board to
  * upgrade/downgrade to prosperity level X (default 1; 0 should also be an option, eg for variant campaigns)
    * upgrade: take them from bag, place in appropriate section by type
    * downgrade: remove them from the city board (not elsewhere) into the bag
    * show/hide above buttons (default hide)
* Map:
  * make prosperity progression track clickable (but pretty, not checkbox buttons)
    * mind FAQ caveat about possibility for temporarily demoted progression
  * expose read/write of progression level & prosperity level
  * make map tiles clickable (to show completion)
  * expose read/write of map state:
    * scenarios list:
      * states:
        * unlocked
        * available (unlocked *and* requirements met)
        * current location
        * failed
        * completed
      * linked from / to (i.e. skip road event)
      * unlocked by (3-digit card # if applicable)
      * requirement conditions

## Advanced

* All-in-one weather / background / theme controller
* Button to replace terrain tokens with 3d model of correct type (including flooring, walls, etc), with variation for aesthetics
* Character & party saver / stager (like Sky Tools Stage, but for the non-board player content)
* Mat:
  * draw/shuffle modifier buttons
  * tap/untap items if present
* Make all side tables work (hide & store objects while not in use)
  * make remote to control them; see e.g. GRID table
* Show/hide toggle buttons (copy from e.g. the GRID remote):
  * help texts
  * map/tokens sidebar
  * tools sidebar
  * gloomhaven city
  * unlockables
  * tuckboxes
  * map
* End of Round button:
  * element board
  * shuffle monster abilities if pile has a shufflable
  * shuffle modifiers if pile has a shufflable
  * flip ID tokens back to number side
